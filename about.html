			<h2> About Me</h2><br>
			<p> My name is Adam Nedens, and I am currently a senior at the University of Jamestown <br>
				in Jamestown, North Dakota. I am studying computer science and play on the golf team. <br><br><br>
				I first got into photography around high school, when I would take pictures on my iPhone on vacations. <br>
				When the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, I decided to experiment with cameras and began to use my mom's old <br>
				Canon EOS Rebel T4 camera. This camera helped me understand the basics of photography and how I can have <br>
				more control over my photos. I hope to continue taking pictures after graduation and <br>expanding my knowledge of
				photography, along with expanding my outreach to more people. <br> <br><br>
				Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my website!</p> <br> <br>
